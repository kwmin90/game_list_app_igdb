# Game list app with search

Built using: Angular, ngx-pagination, IGDB API 

# Before running the app, make sure you change the user-key in igdb.service.ts file with an api key from https://www.igdb.com/api

Allows users to search for games and add them to a list displayed in the home page.
The home page will be overwritten with games added by the user.
The initial list contains my favorite games :)
